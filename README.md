## Introduction

In recent years, there has been growing recognition of the importance of mental health and well-being. However, identifying and addressing mental health conditions in a timely manner remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods of monitoring mental health, such as clinical assessments and surveys, often suffer from limitations such as high cost, stigma, and delays in data collection and analysis.Mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, affect millions of individuals worldwide. Social media platforms have emerged as a valuable source of data for monitoring and understanding mental health trends and behaviours.
This project aims to leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze social media posts, particularly tweets from Twitter, to detect signs of mental health conditions and identify individuals at risk of suicidal ideation. By harnessing the power of social media data, we seek to provide early interventions and support for those in distress.

## Objectives

Develop machine learning models to detect linguistic markers and patterns associated with mental health conditions, including depression and suicidal ideation, in social media posts.
Implement a scalable system for real-time monitoring and analysis of mental health-related content on Twitter.
Integrate suicide detection algorithms into the monitoring system to identify individuals at risk of self-harm or suicide.
Provide actionable alerts to mental health professionals, crisis intervention teams, and social media platform moderators to facilitate timely interventions and support.

## Dataset:


### Dataset Details

The dataset utilized in this analysis originates from Kaggle and comprises posts from the "SuicideWatch" and "depression" subreddits on Reddit, acquired through the Pushshift API.
Specifically, posts from "SuicideWatch" were collected from December 16, 2008 (the subreddit's inception) to January 2, 2021.

Posts from the "depression" subreddit were gathered from January 1, 2009, to January 2, 2021.

Categorized labeling assigns posts from "SuicideWatch" as suicide-related, while those from the "depression" subreddit are marked as pertaining to depression.

Additionally, non-suicidal posts are drawn from the "teenagers" subreddit.

Initially, the dataset featured labels solely for suicide and non-suicide posts.

Subsequent iterations, such as version V13, expanded the labeling scheme to encompass depression and normal conversations among teenagers.

Supplementary documentation, in the form of a notebook, illustrates the methodology for obtaining Reddit posts via the PushShift API.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the potential of NLP and machine learning techniques to monitor mental health conditions and detect signs of suicidal ideation from social media data, particularly tweets from Twitter. By analysing online communication patterns, we can identify individuals at risk and facilitate timely interventions and support. Moving forward, further research and collaboration are needed to enhance the accuracy and scalability of mental health condition monitoring systems and strengthen suicide prevention efforts globally.
