Project Title: Mental Health Condition Monitoring from Social Media

Introduction

In recent years, there has been growing recognition of the importance of mental health and well-being. However, identifying and addressing mental health conditions in a timely manner remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods of monitoring mental health, such as clinical assessments and surveys, often suffer from limitations such as high cost, stigma, and delays in data collection and analysis.

To address these challenges, our project aims to leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze social media posts for signs of mental health conditions. By harnessing the vast amount of user-generated content on social media platforms, we seek to provide early warnings and insights into population mental health trends.
